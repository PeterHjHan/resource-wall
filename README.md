# WallNOPOLY

A collaborative resource wall (Pinterest clone) with a Monopoly property card theme.
Any resource can be found through the topics dropdown or search query. Registered/logged in users are able to create, like, rate, and comment on other users' posts. On users' pages, created and liked posts are saved for convenient referral.

This was a collaborative project with [Peter Han](https://github.com/PeterHjHan), [Bassem Kaddour](https://github.com/bassemkaddour), and [Monica Lee](https://github.com/monicasoojilee).
